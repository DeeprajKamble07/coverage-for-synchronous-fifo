# coverage-for-synchronous-fifo
Functional coverage for a synchronous FIFO ensures that all meaningful operational scenarios are exercised during verification. Coverage points are defined on key control signals such as write enable, read enable, reset, and status flags including full and empty. Data coverage is added to verify that different data patterns are correctly written to and read from the FIFO. Addressing pointer behavior is also covered by observing write and read pointer increments, pointer wrap-around conditions, and simultaneous read–write operations to ensure correct FIFO sequencing under all valid conditions.

In addition to individual coverpoints, cross-coverage is used to validate interactions between control signals and FIFO states, such as write operations when the FIFO is full or read attempts when it is empty. Coverage also includes important corner cases like FIFO transitioning from empty to non-empty and from full to non-full, as well as back-to-back read and write operations. Achieving high functional coverage confirms that the synchronous FIFO design is thoroughly verified for both normal and boundary conditions, reducing the risk of data loss or overflow in real hardware implementations.
